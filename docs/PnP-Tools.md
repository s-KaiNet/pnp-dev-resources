# PnP Tools

> PnP Tools repository contains more tools, code packages and scripts for the on-premises and hybrid setup, than purely for the Office 365 operations. Using classic terminology, this could be considered more targeted for IT Pro's, Architects and administrators in on-premises deployments.
