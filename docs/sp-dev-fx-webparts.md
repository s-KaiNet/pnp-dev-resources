# Client-Side Web Part Samples & Tutorial Materials

> This repository contains community samples that demonstrate different usage patterns for the SharePoint Framework client-side web parts.

> SharePoint client-side web parts are controls that appear inside a SharePoint page but run locally in the browser. They're the building blocks of pages that appear on a SharePoint site. You can build client-side web parts using modern script development tools and the SharePoint workbench (a development test surface), and you can deploy your client-side web parts to classic web part pages in Office 365 tenants. In addition to plain JavaScript projects, you can build web parts alongside common scripting frameworks, such as AngularJS and React. For example, you can use React along with components from Office UI Fabric React to quickly create experiences based on the same components used in Office 365.
